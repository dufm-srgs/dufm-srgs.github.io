    <h2>What we do</h2>

    <h3>Analyze Problems</h3>

    <p>
        We explore various topics in mathematics, challenging ourselves to think critically and creatively about the world around us.
        Whether working alone or in groups, this course prepares you to tackle a wide variety of problems with confidence.
    </p>

    <h3>Explore and Create</h3>

    <p>
        Explore problems via graphs, simulations, and other visualizations. Look for patterns and connections in your data
        and use them to conjecture and prove new results.
    </p>

    <h3>Prove and Justify</h3>

    <p>
        Back up your conjectures with rigorous proofs. Learn to write proofs that are clear, concise, and convincing.
